/**
 * Loader options for the `ng-router-loader`.
 *
 * ## Resource specific options
 * Some options apply to a resource, the global option serve as the default but can be overridden in a resource URI using query parameters.
 *
 * >Resource specific options are marked with the **resource_override** tag.
 *
 * #### AOT mode
 * Some of the options apply on when the `aot` flag is set to **true**.
 *
 * >AOT specific options are marked with the **aot_mode** tag.
 *
 *
 * ## Usage
 * #### Webpack 1
 * ```ts
 * {
 *    test: /\.ts$/,
 *    loaders: [
 *      'awesome-typescript-loader',
 *      'ng-router-loader?aot=true&genDir=codegen'
 *    ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * #### Webpack 2
 * You can use the query string as well as:
 * ```ts
 * {
 *    test: /\.ts$/,
 *    use: [
 *      'awesome-typescript-loader',
 *      {
 *         loader: 'ng-router-loader',
 *         options: {
 *           aot: true,
 *           genDir: 'codegen'
 *         }
 *      }
 *    ]
 * }
 * ```
